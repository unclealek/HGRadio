# HGGradio Project

This project demonstrates the integration of Gradio (a Python library for creating web interfaces) with Rust code via PyO3 bindings.

## Project Structure

HGGradio/ ├── app.py # Main Gradio application ├── try.py # Testing/experimental file ├── my_pyo3_project/ # Rust integration with Python │ ├── Cargo.toml # Rust project configuration │ └── src/ │ └── main.rs # Rust source code └── .gradio/ # Gradio configuration └── certificate.pem # SSL certificate





## Features

- Web interface using Gradio
- Rust backend integration using PyO3
- SSL support for secure connections

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Gradio
- PyO3

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install gradio
Build the Rust component:



cd my_pyo3_project
cargo build --release
Usage
Run the main application:




python app.py
Security
The project includes SSL support through the certificate in the .gradio directory.

Development
app.py: Contains the main Gradio interface implementation
try.py: Used for testing and experimental features
my_pyo3_project: Contains Rust code that can be called from Python using PyO3
